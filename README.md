# Life-Expectancy-Prediction_World-Health-Organization

### In this project, we have used Machine Learning Regression Models to predict the life expectancy of people in various countries of the world using WHO data

## Models used:
1. K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
2. Linear Regression
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor
4. Ridge and Lasso Regression 
5. Polynomial Regression
6. Decision Tree Regressor
7. Support Vector Machines SVM (Linear, Kernel SVR - Linear, Poly, RBF)
8. Bagging and Pasting
9. Boosting - Adaboost, Gradient Boost
10. PCA for dimensionality reduction
